Pokemon with Phaser
====
Workshop was presented for the first time during Devoxx4Kids at Devoxx US in March 2017 in San Jose.
It's a simple game written in Javascript and HTML. It uses a game engine called Phaser. Participants are not expected to write this game from scratch, only to make some modifications to it.

Workshop is split into a few parts:

* quick presentation of a game itself
* a few exercises to practice simple JavaScript structures (variables, functions, conditional statements)
* explanation how code is connected to what participants see in the game
* time for modifications made by participants

Examplary modifications are mentioned in the presentation.

Only requirement for participants is to have Chrome browser (although Phaser should work on all popular browsers, but this app was tested on Chrome) and text editor (a little better than Windows Notepad, eg. Notepad++ on Windows or TextWrangler on Mac OS) installed. No knowledge of JavaScript or HTML is necessary, although it's obviously helpful.
