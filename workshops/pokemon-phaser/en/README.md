Pokemon with Phaser
====
Workshop was presented for the first time during Devoxx4Kids at Devoxx US in March 2017 in San Jose.
It's a simple game written in Javascript and HTML. It uses a game engine called Phaser. Participants are not expected to write this game from scratch, only to make some modifications to it.

Workshop is split into a few parts:

* quick presentation of a game itself
* a few exercises to practice simple JavaScript structures (variables, functions, conditional statements)
* explanation how code is connected to what participants see in the game
* time for modifications

Examplary modifications are mentioned in the presentation.
