== Step 1: A little quiz to start
The robot  mBot is composed of different parts. The main part called Electronic Card "mCore" is a card based on an Arduino microcontroller.

Together we will try to identify the different items on the mCore card.

. Sound buzzer
. 2 RGB Leds
. IR Emitter Led (InfraRed)
. IR Receiver Led (InfraRed)
. Light sensor
. Push Button
. Motor connectors
. Power Switch
. Ultrasonic Sensor Connector
. Line follower Connector 


== Step 2: Begin to program the robot
The objective of this step is to move the robot with the keyboard. For this, we will use the mBlock software.

- Copy the following program:

- Connect the robot and execute the program.
- Can you explain the instructions of the program?

== Step 3: Do the same for the other direction keys
- Can you do the same for other direction keys?
- Try your new program?
- What can you add to make it more fun?

== Step 4: Using the ultrasonic sensor
Use the following elements to view the ultrasonic sensor values.

What can you deduce of the displayed values?


== Step 5: Sound and light
- Using the ultrasonic sensor and light sensor, vary both multi-colored LEDs.
- Adds music notes.
