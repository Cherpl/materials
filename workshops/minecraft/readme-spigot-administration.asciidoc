[[Requirements]]
== Requirements

* A paid Minecraft account
* A Mac or a Windows computer

[[Download]]
== Download and Install
. **JDK:** Download and install JDK from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
. **Spigot Build Tools:** Download the Spigot build tools from https://hub.spigotmc.org/jenkins/job/BuildTools/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/BuildTools.jar
. __Windows only__ **Git for Windows**: Download and install from https://git-for-windows.github.io
. Create a `spigot` folder on your desktop.
. Copy `BuildTools.jar` into your `spigot` folder.

[[UsingTheCommandPrompt]]
== Using the command prompt
The first step to running your own server is opining your computer's command prompt. You will use the command prompt
to run and interact with the Spigot server.

=== Mac
. In Finder, go to Applications, Utilities, and double click on Terminal
. Change folder to Desktop: `cd Desktop`
. Change to the folder: `cd spigot`

=== Windows
. Open the start menu and run `gitbash.exe`
. Change folder to Desktop: `cd Desktop`
. Change to the folder: `cd spigot`

[[StartTheServer]]
== Start the server for the first time
. Run BuildTools to download the Spigot server: `java -jar BuildTools.jar --rev 1.10`
. Wait a few minutes
. Start the Spigot server for the first time: `java -jar craftbukkit-1.10.jar`
** The server will stop and you will see a message like `[15:24:34 INFO]: You need to agree to the EULA in order to run the server. Go to eula.txt for more info.`
. Open up the "`eula.txt`" file by double-clicking on it. Change the text "`eula=false`" to "`eula=true`" and save it
. Start the server again: `java -jar craftbukkit-1.10.jar`
** After the server starts, you should see a line like `[23:24:49 INFO]: Done (13.469s)! For help, type "help" or "?"`.

=== Verify
This step is important because it makes sure that your server is working correctly.

. Open up the Minecraft client
** Make sure version 1.10 is selected
. Click on the "`Multiplayer`" button
. Click "`Add server`"
. In the "`Server Address`" box, type in `localhost`
** The server name can be whatever you want
. Click "`Done`"
. Double-click on the server to connect
** The server should say "`A Minecraft Server`" under the server name

[[Commands]]
== Issuing Commands
Server commands are what you use to control your Minecraft server. You can always issue server commands from
the server command prompt. Once you give yourself Op status on your server, you can also issue commands from the
Minecraft chat window.

=== Getting Help
If you forget how to control your server, use the `help` command to get a list of all available commands.

. From the server command prompt, use the help command: `help`
. You will see a list of all the commands your server understands
. Use the help command to get h: `help op`
. The help description for the Op command tells you how it is used: `[23:35:14 INFO]: Usage: /op <player>`

=== Making yourself Op
You can always issue any command from the server command prompt, but it is easier to issue commands from within the game.
To issue server commands from within Minecraft itself, you have to give your player Op status on the server. Op is short
for __Operator__. Any server Op can issue every server command.

. From the server command prompt, use the op command: `op <player>`
** Replace `<player>` with your player name

=== Giving yourself items
Once you have given yourself Op status, you can issue commands from withing Minecraft itself. The first command we will
use is `/give`, to give yourself items in game.

. Switch to your Minecraft client and connect to your server
. Open the chat window by pressing the slash key: `/`
. Give yourself a Diamond Sword: `/give <player> diamond_sword`
. Give yourself 64 Diamonds: `/give <player> diamond 64`
** The list of all items you can give yourself is at http://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com/

=== Changing your game mode
The `/gamemode` command is used to switch between Creative and Survival mode.

. Switch your game mode to Creative: `/gamemode creative`
. Switch your game mode back to Survival: `/gamemode survival`

=== Controlling time
The `/time` command is used to control time in the game.

. Make it night time: `/time set night`
. Make it day time: `/time set day`

=== Controlling the weather
The `/weather` command is used to control the weather in the game.

. Start a thunderstorm: `/weather thunder`
. Clear the sky: `/weather clear`

=== Stop the server
The `/stop` command is used to safely shut down the server.

. Stop the server: `/stop`
** **Never close the server console without using the `/stop` command first. You will lose work and may ruin your world.**

[[InstallingPlugins]]
== Installing Plugins
Plugins let you add new features to your Minecraft server. You can download plugins from the Bukkit website and the
Spigot website. To install a plugin, copy the plugin `.jar` file into your server's `plugins` folder.

=== Downloading a plugin
Plugins can be downloaded from either the Bukkit website or the Spigot website. For this exercise, we will install
the Giant Trees plugin.

. Open your web browser and go to the Giant Trees plugin page: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/giant-trees/
. Click on the `Files` link at the top of the page
. Click the link for the latest version for your game version: `2.0.0-alpha.6`
. The plugin `.jar` file will download to your your computer's download folder

=== Installing a plugin
To install a plugin, copy it to your server's `plugins` folder and restart the server.

. Make sure your server is stopped. Use the `/stop` command if it isn't.
. Move `GiantTrees-2.0.0-alpha.6.jar` into the server's `plugins` folder.
** The `plugins` folder should be in the `spigot` folder on your desktop.
. Start the server again: `java -jar craftbukkit-1.10.jar`
. Use the plugins server command to make sure Giant Trees is installed: `plugins`

=== Configure a plugin
Many plugins you download can be customized by editing their configuration file.

. Stop your server from the server command prompt: `stop`
. Open the server's `plugins` folder
. Open the `GiantTrees` folder
. Open the `config.yml` file
. Change the value for `treeGrowthPercentChance` from `0.5` to `3`
. Save your changes and close the file
. Start the server again: `java -jar craftbukkit-1.10.jar`
. Log into your server
. Walk around looking for a giant tree :)
